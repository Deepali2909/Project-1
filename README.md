Simple Calculator

This presentation outlines the creation of a Simple Calculator using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library. It provides an introduction to building a graphical user interface (GUI) that supports basic arithmetic operations through buttons for digits and mathematical symbols. Import Tkinter, create the main window, and set up the display. Create functions for updating input, calculating results, and clearing the display. Use Tkinter's grid() method to arrange buttons and the input field in an intuitive interface. Start the event loop using root.mainloop() to keep the app responsive. The presentation highlights both code structure and GUI functionality, demonstrating fundamental concepts of event handling and user interaction.
